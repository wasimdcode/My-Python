#today i will make simple program using Expressions
Length = int(input("Enter Length of a Rectangle"))
Breadth = int(input("Enter Breadth of a Rectangle"))
Area = Length * Breadth
print("Area of Reactangle is ", Area)
#the Area of Triangle formula 1/2bh
Base = int(input("Enter Base of a Triangle"))
Height = int(input('Enter Height of a Triangle'))
Area = 1/2 * Base * Height
print('Area of Triangle', Area)
