# it Will show Multiplication Table of Entered Number with the help of "for Loop"
n = int(input("Enter A Number "))
num = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 
for x in num: #it will run a loop for each array in "msg" 
    t = n * x #it will Multipy "n" to all arrays in Msg and store value in "t"
    print(n,"*","X","=",t) #it is final output as time table 
# i made this program by myself
# this is by my teacher you can create also like this 
# n = int(input("Enter a Number"))
# for count in range(1,11):
    #print(n,"X",count,"=",count * n)
